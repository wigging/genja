In Swift, arrays are ordered collections that store values of the same type, providing fast indexed access and dynamic resizing. You can create them with literals like [1, 2, 3] or with initializers such as Array(repeating: 0, count: 5). Swift arrays are value types, meaning theyâ€™re copied on assignment, but they use copy-on-write optimization for efficiency. They come with powerful methods like map, filter, and reduce for functional transformations, as well as mutating operations like append and remove.
