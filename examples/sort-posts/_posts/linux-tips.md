Keep your Linux workflow smooth with a few handy tips: use Ctrl+R in the terminal to quickly search your command history, and !! to repeat the last command (add sudo !! to rerun it with elevated privileges). Chain commands with && to run the next one only if the first succeeds, or with ; to run regardless of success. Keep htop or btop installed for real-time process monitoring, and df -h or du -sh * to keep an eye on disk usage. Remember to use tab completion for faster navigation, and alias in your .bashrc or .zshrc to save keystrokes for frequently used commands.
