macOS development offers a polished environment for building apps with Swift, Objective-C, and SwiftUI using Xcode, Appleâ€™s all-in-one IDE. You can leverage Cocoa and AppKit frameworks for native desktop features, while SwiftUI provides a modern declarative UI approach that works across macOS, iOS, and other Apple platforms. The built-in Terminal, Unix-based foundation, and developer tools like Instruments make performance profiling and debugging straightforward. With support for Catalyst, you can even adapt iPad apps to run natively on macOS, expanding your reach with minimal extra effort.
