Apples are crisp, sweet (or tart) fruits that come in a rainbow of varieties, from bright red to golden yellow and fresh green. They’re enjoyed fresh, baked into pies, pressed into cider, or even dried for a chewy snack. Packed with fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, apples have been a staple in diets around the world for centuries—proving that sometimes the simplest foods are the most timeless.
