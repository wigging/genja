Examples
========

Examples are available in the ``genja/examples`` directory in the genja `GitHub <https://github.com/wigging/genja>`_ repository. Use the ``genja build`` or ``genja serve`` command to generate the HTML for a particular example. For instance, use the command shown below to build the website and run a local server for the ``directory-output`` example. The website will automatically reload in the web browser when changes are saved to the Markdown files.

.. code:: text

   cd examples/directory-output
   genja serve

Alternatively, use the build command to build the website without starting a local server.

.. code:: text

   cd examples/directory-output
   genja build

Code blocks
-----------

The ``code-blocks`` example demonstrates the use of `highlight.js <https://highlightjs.org>`_ to provide syntax coloring of code that is rendered in pages and posts. The CSS and JavaScript for hightlightjs must be defined in the ``<head>...</head>`` section in the HTML page or post template such as:

.. code:: html

   <!-- Highlightjs -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.5.0/styles/github-dark.min.css">
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.5.0/highlight.min.js"></script>
   <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>

Next, code blocks can be defined in the Markdown files as follows:

.. code:: text

   ```python
   def seyhello():
       s = "hello there"
       print(s)
   ```

Directory output
----------------

The ``directory-output`` example defines ``site_output = "mysite"`` in the ``genja.toml`` file. This tells Genja to output the generated content to the ``mysite`` directory in the project.

.. code:: text

   directory-output/
   ├── _pages/
   ├── _posts/
   ├── _templates/
   ├── mysite/      <-- output from Genja will go in this directory
   └── genja.toml

HTML content
------------

The ``html-content`` example demonstrates putting HTML in the Markdown file. The ``about.md`` in the example uses the ``<figure>`` element to display an image with a caption.

.. code:: html

   <figure>
     <img src="images/homer-simpson.jpg" alt="Homer Simpson" />
     <figcaption>An image of Homer Simpson is in this figure.</figcaption>
   </figure>

The same is done in the ``apple.md`` post but notice the path to the image file is adjusted for the post.

.. code:: html

   <figure>
     <img src="../images/apple.jpg" alt="an apple" />
     <figcaption>This is an image of an apple.</figcaption>
   </figure>

Image files
-----------

The ``image-files`` example shows how to embed images in the Markdown file. This is accomplished as shown below but notice the path to the image file may vary for pages and posts.

.. code:: markdown

   ![Homer Simpson](images/homer-simpson.jpg)

Pages and posts
---------------

The ``pages-and-posts`` examples demonstrates creating pages and posts as Markdown files. Pages reside in the ``_pages`` directory while posts reside in the ``_posts`` directory.

Root output
-----------

The ``root-output`` example generates the HTML website content at the root level of the project. This is defined in the ``genja.toml`` config file by setting the ``site_output`` to the current working directory as shown below:

.. code:: toml

   base_url = "https://example.com"
   posts_output = "blog"
   site_output = "."
   title = "My Website"

Sort posts
----------

The ``sort-posts`` example shows how to sort posts by date, category, or tag. A demonstration of sorting only recent posts is also given. This is accomplished with the Jinja template engine. See the `Template Designer Documentation <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templates/>`_ for more information about creating Jinja templates.
